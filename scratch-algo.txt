take the first element of the array

look through the rest of the array to find the
lowest value in it, and then swap the
first element with it

move to the next element

repeat





can easily iterate using for
or a recursive function

should I use the sort function, or find
some other way?  the sort would be the easiest

but I really only need the smallest element

never mind, can use use (apply min list)




MERGE SORT

divide the list in half 
repeat until it is as small as possible (single element)



each piece can be sorted against an empty piece, then sort against each other all the way up
because if they are sorted below, then when compared they will also be sorted


car cdr the pieces

how to get the pieces?
