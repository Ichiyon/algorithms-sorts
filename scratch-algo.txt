take the first element of the array

look through the rest of the array to find the
lowest value in it, and then swap the
first element with it


can easily iterate using for
or a recursive function

should I use the sort function, or find
some other way?  the sort would be the easiest

but I really only need the smallest element

never mind, can use use (apply min list)
